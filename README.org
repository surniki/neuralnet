* neuralnet: Biophysical Neural Net Simulation

#+html: <p align="center"><img src="wave_cancellation.gif" width="400" /></p>

  The /neuralnet/ program is meant to be used for exploring the
  behavior of biophysical neural networks by allowing systems to be
  described by the user from the command line. It is meant to allow
  the user to quickly see how a system behaves. It supports outputting
  data files for the simulation (using the ~--output-data~ flag),
  which include the dynamical variables as well as interpretations of
  the data such as a voltage matrix and a raster plot data file for
  plotting when an action potential occurs in the network.

  Another option that is available is to use the ~--visualize~ flag to
  be able to see the time evolution of the system graphically. The
  right arrow key simulates the system forward in time and the up
  arrow key and down arrow key increases and decreases the time step
  used in the numerical integration respectively. The animation above
  is an example of this mode of the program being used.

** Building from source
   Because of the ~--visualize~ option, this project depends on the
   SDL2 and SDL2_ttf libraries. This program has been tested on Linux,
   namely Debian and Fedora. 
  
   On Debian:
   #+begin_src sh
     sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
   #+end_src

   On Fedora:
   #+begin_src sh
     sudo dnf install SDL2-devel SDL2_ttf-devel
   #+end_src
   
   Once the development libraries have been installed, the program can
   be compiled using the Makefile.
   
   #+begin_src sh
     make && ./bin/test_neuralnet
   #+end_src
